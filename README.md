# Project8_Pomodoro
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management methoddeveloped by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. 
It uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. 
Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.
